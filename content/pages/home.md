Welcome to my little slice of the Internet. Little indeed, I do not keep much of a presence here. But I do quite enjoy using technology to solve problems in elegant ways. I work in Linux environments and mostly program in Python. Checkout my GitHub and LinkedIn links along the left for more information. I also quite like testing human ability with endurance sports and day dreaming about whether we exist in a computer simulation and about the pros and cons of voluntarily entering into a computer simulation.

# Notable GitHub links
Just one for now, but, I recently starting keeping an on going cheatsheet of things I use pretty often, it can be found [here](https://github.com/torypages/random/blob/master/things_i_forget.md).
